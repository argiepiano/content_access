<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This section contains notes about how to
integrate with <strong>Rules</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Rules integrations only work on individual
nodes.  The rules for access control that you set up will not be
executed <em>unless</em> you have checked “Enable per content node
access control settings”. You find this checkbox under the “Access
Control” tab located on the settings page for the content type.</p>

  
<h2>Rules integrations example</h2>

<p>In this example, we shall set up 

<p>You can make <strong>Content Access</strong> act in much more
sophisticated ways by using the <strong>Rules</strong> module. The
project is fully integrated with <strong>Rules</strong>, so you can
automatically set permissions for different types of content.</p>

<ul>
<li>Install and the <strong>Rules</strong> project.</li>
<li>Enable both the <strong>Rules</strong> and <strong>Rules UI</strong> modules.</li>
<li>Enable the <strong>Content Access Rules Integrations</strong module.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the example we are going to show you, we have a user role called
“Writer”. These people will add content to our site, but we do not
want their content to be visible by everyone. We only want it to be
visible to people in another user role called “Editors”. Here is how we
can set this up:</p>

<ul>
<li>Set up the “Writer” and “Editor” roles.</li>
<li>Navigate to <span class="nav">Configuration » Workflow » Rules<span>.</li>
<li>Click “Add new rule”.</li>
</ul>
