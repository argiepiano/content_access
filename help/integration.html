<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This section contains notes about how to integrate <strong>Content
Access</strong> with other modules.</p>

<p>I have not tested these myself, so I do not guarantee that the
suggestion collected below actually work.  They are just to keep the
links to the workarounds posted somewhere on the web in a single
file.</p>

<p>If you spot link rot, or wrong information, on this page, please
report it using the project's
 <a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues/content_access">issue queue</a>.</p>
